# SN-CICD
Repository for CI/CD eLearning - Setting up a CI/CD Pipeline using GitHub Actions
1. The Dev instance will need to push an application to a GitHub repository and this repository will need to connect with both - Dev and Test - instances to execute our pipeline.
2. You will create necessary users and credentials to allow ServiceNow to talk to GitHub and vice versa. This involves creating a GitHub Personal Access Token as well as ServiceNow local account with access to the CI/CD APIs.
